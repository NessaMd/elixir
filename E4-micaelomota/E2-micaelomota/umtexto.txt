With multi-agent systems (MASs) growing in size and complexity, 
the separation of their concerns throughout the different development phases is crucial to MAS engineers.
Separation of concerns is a well-known principle in software engineering to achieve improved reusability 
and maintainability of complex software. 
Hence it is necessary to investigate systematically whether abstractions 
from object-oriented (OO) software engineering are able to isolate explicitly MAS concerns.
This paper presents an empirical study that evaluates the degree to which abstractions 
associated with two OO techniques enable modularization of MAS concerns. 
The selected techniques involve basic OO abstractions, such as classes and objects, and more sophisticated ones, namely design patterns and aspects
